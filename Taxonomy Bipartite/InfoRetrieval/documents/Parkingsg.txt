Known Issues:
* Confirmation screen gets partially cut-off on the HTC U11 and HTC 10 because of HTC Boost+ app optimisation. Turn off the Boost+ app optimisation for the app and it will work.
* Delayed notifications on China brand phones like Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo. This is due to their aggressive battery optimisation. Add the app to the Protected Apps list to solve the delayed notifications issue.
