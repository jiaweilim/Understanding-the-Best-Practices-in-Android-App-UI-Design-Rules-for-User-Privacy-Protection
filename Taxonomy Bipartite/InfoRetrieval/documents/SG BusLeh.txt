Note on App Permissions

The app permission system on Android is really broken. As long as we request for any permission within any permission group, Android would display a permission warning for the entire permission group, which can be confusing.

For example, we request for permission to generate custom bitmap. This permission belongs to the same group as SD card permission, leading to Android warning you about SD card access. Please trust us, we are not so bo liao to be interested in your personal data.
