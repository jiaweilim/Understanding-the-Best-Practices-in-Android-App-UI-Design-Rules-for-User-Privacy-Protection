What is Reddit? Reddit is where topics or ideas are arranged in communities. Start off with what you like and go from there. There are 100K active ones to choose from.

Joining your favorite communities will create a constant, personalized feed of content like news headlines, fun stories, sports talk, games, viral pics, top memes, and videos.

Earn fake Internet points (called Karma) by sharing your passion for books, movies, video games, sports, TV shows, music and technology with millions of people who share your interests.

Or just browse what millions of other people are posting and talking about.
