APP PERMISSIONS

In order to provide the service, the app requires certain permissions.

[Mandatory]
“Phone”: This permission is used to obtain your device’s IMEI, among other parameters, to secure the app and generate a unique ID to tag the app to your device.

[Mandatory]
“Storage”, may also be known as “Photos, media and files”: This permission allows the app to obtain additional parameters from the device storage hardware as one of the factors in deriving the unique ID for enhanced security. A file is also created on your storage to save your troubleshooting ID when logs are sent to our Helpdesk.

The following requirements are recommended for an optimised user experience:

- Minimum Android version 6

COMMON ISSUES

If you’re encountering a “settings altered” prompt, it may be due to a rooted device. Certain apps that provide fake GPS or remote administration functions may also cause the prompt to be shown. While the team is continuously assessing these apps, users may choose to uninstall such apps to use Singpass app.

If you’re encountering a “request expired” prompt, try setting your device to use “Automatic Date & Time” or “Automatic Timezone”. The exact name may differ according to your device, and can be found in your device settings.
